# Computing in Context - Final Project
This website showcases all 3 of my projects for the computing in context course. 

Project 1 focuses on showing the value of Pandas, by showing how similar tasks would have to be done in pure python, in constrast with through Pandas. 

Project 2 allowed me to apply skills I learned in cleaning and analyzing data on a real dataset. 
It analyzes Amazon sales in India and how it changed over a period. 

Project 3 tests similar skills by looking at the Right to Know Act passed in New York in 2018 and studying its effect on trends of citizens' complaints on police officers and the outcomes of these complaints.
